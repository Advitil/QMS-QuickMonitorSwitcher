# QMS - QuickMonitorSwitcher

One click on/off secondary screen

Uses displayswitch to toggle your screen in windows and ddcci commands to turn off / on your monitor.  
It is really basic and will maybe be expanded to support multiple monitors one day.

**Please ensure your monitor supports power mode control before use.**
